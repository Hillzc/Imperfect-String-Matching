# Final-Project
 
An implementation of few different imperfect string matching algorithms. 

To try each one out, try editing test.txt and running main.py. The first line of test.txt is the pattern, the second line is the text, and the third line is the maximum number of allowed errors.

Usage: 

python main.py AlgorithmType Filter
 
AlgorithmType: [Naive/DP/Bitap]
 
Filter: [ON/OFF]

You can also run naive.py, dp.py, bitap.py, or filter.py directly.
