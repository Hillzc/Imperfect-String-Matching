project ideas:

- searching for imperfect genes in sequence 
	- shouldn't be hard to account for replacements
	- probably harder to account for insertions/deletions

	- like local alignment, but modify kmp so we don't have to take up huge memory

	- probabilistic suffix trees
	- imperfect string match

	- come up with abstract of a few sentences and 2-3 papers and email to estelle
	- email sorin with papers

	- do a survey of existing methods and implement some and do comparison


- navarro
	- doesn't include probabilistic methods

	- covers a lot of methods that i probably wouldn't be able to cover in 15 minutes so i'll want to focus on a few:

	- based on dp matrix
	- automaton


- start with defining the problem
	- what exactly do we mean by "imperfect", and how to quantify this

	- dynamic programming
	- automaton

	- only talk about/implement one algorithm from each of these options and mention the benefits of each approach in general 

	- a third one: shift-or? bit parallelism?
	- counter-vector-mismatches (CVM) algorithm

how long of a paper should we write? i can't fit details in a 15 minute presentation but i can try to implement every algorithm i mention and give example runtimes/outputs
